     biography: "Lazar Joksimovic recently graduated from the University of Toronto (St. George Campus). He triple majored in Physiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics & Microbiology. After volunteering with children affected by debilitating rare genetic conditions, he was motivated to spread awareness and push the field forward towards finding cures for these fatal illnesses. Lazar is an aspiring physician-scientist who has devoted his undergraduate years to investigating the biology of genetically-mediated diseases. His research projects range from characterizing oncogenic drivers of tumorigenesis in rare hereditary cancer syndromes in Dr. Uri Tabori’s laboratory, to deciphering the molecular mechanisms of over 40 neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases in Dr. Christopher Pearson’s laboratory. He will be pursuing MD-PhD training in the United States, where he hopes to continue pushing the boundaries of our understanding of genetically mediated diseases. If you share the same passions as Lazar, please feel free to apply for a position in GSGGB’s executive team 😊. He enjoys working with a multi-disciplinary team of science enthusiasts!",
